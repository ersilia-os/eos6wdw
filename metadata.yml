Title: dotP embeddings
Description: Antibiotic-activity informed chemical descriptors trained on a set 90k molecules for which we know antibiotic activity against >600 bacterial species. The model was trained for molecular reconstruction and antibiotic activity prediction tasks simultaneously, so that the output descriptors capture both chemistry and antibiotic effect features.
